# This is the readme file.
This project is a derivative of the work done by the Tufts Maker Network, (see their GitHub at https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Documentation-Station)  Ultimately, however, the project is different enough that it warrants a unique repository of its own.

# Dependencies
The dependencies for this project are listed as all the packages imported into Python at the beginning of greenscreenMain.py.  However, they are:
* Python 2.7
* The Python Imaging Library
* pigpio (RPi GPIO Library)
* The os Library
* Others as listed in the main file.

Goodluck, and please feel free to contact me or us at WMSI if you have questions or need help.

# Documentation
I sincerely hope the in-script documentation is thorough enough for you to understand and use it.  If not, please just yell at someone, and I'll try to update this or serve whatever you may need.
