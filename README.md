# This is the readme file.
This project is a derivative of the work done by the Tufts Maker Network, (see their GitHub at https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Documentation-Station)  Ultimately, however, the project is different enough that it warrants a unique repository of its own.

# Dependencies
The dependencies for this project are listed as all the packages imported into Python at the beginning of greenscreenMain.py.  However, they are:
* Python 2.7
* The Python Imaging Library
* pigpio (RPi GPIO Library)
* The os Library
* Others as listed in the main file.

Goodluck, and please feel free to contact me or us at WMSI if you have questions or need help.
